# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN – A deep learning model to classify facial images into 7 emotions (Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise) using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.


# 😄 Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify facial images into **7 distinct emotions**:  
😠 Anger | 😒 Contempt | 🤢 Disgust | 😨 Fear | 😄 Happiness | 😢 Sadness | 😲 Surprise

The system uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to recognize human emotions from facial expressions.
